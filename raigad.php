                  Raigad is a hill fort situated in Mahad, Raigad district of Maharashtra, India. Many constructions and structures that we see on raigad were built by chatrapati Shivaji when he made it his capital in 1674 when he was crowned the King of the Maratha Kingdom which later developed into the Maratha Empire, eventually covering much of western and central India. The fort rises 820 metres (2,700 ft) above the sea level and is located in the Sahyadri mountain range. There are approximately 1737 steps leading to the fort. The Raigad Ropeway, an aerial tramway exists.The height of this ropeway is 400 meters in height and 750 meters in length and takes only 4 minutes.

        History of Raigad:
    </b></p>
    <p><b>
      In 1656 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Seized the fort, then known as the fort of Rairi from Chandraraoji More, the king of javali (jawali). <br><br>
      After capturing this fort Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj seeing the natural protection this fort had and also strategically important place in future as From Rairi one can keep an eye on Panvel and the Konkan region and seeing the adjoining mountains surrounding and protecting the fort from all sides, Maharaj said “तक्तास जागा हाच गड करावा”
      and renamed the fort as Raigad and renovated and Expanded the fort, Hiroji Indulkar a skilled engineer and architect of his times, was given the task to build this fort. And announced this fort as the second capital of Swarajya. <br><br>

        <center><h4>Coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h4></center> 
        </div>
      
    </div>
    <p><b>On 6th June 1674 Shivaji Maharaj was crowned as the king of Maratha Swaraj in a lavish ceremony,  In the Hindu calendar it was on the 13th day (trayodashi) of the first fortnight of the month of Jyeshtha in the year 1596.[97] Gaga Bhatt officiated, holding a gold vessel filled with the seven sacred waters of the rivers Yamuna, Indus, Ganges, Godavari, Narmada, Krishna and Kaveri over Maharaja's head, and chanted the Vedic coronation mantras.<br><br>
       After the ablution, Shivaji Maharaj bowed before Rajmata Jijabai and touched her feet. Nearly fifty thousand people gathered at Raigad for the ceremonies. Maharaj was entitled Shakakarta ("founder of an era") and Chhatrapati ("paramount sovereign"). He also took the title of Haindava Dharmodhhaarak (protector of the Hindu faith). Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj sat on the throne, ornamented with emblems and auspicious materials. Gaga Bhatt, a Hindu scholar conducted the ceremony. Maharaj was bestowed upon the title of ‘Kshatriya Kulavantas Chhatrapati Raje Shivaji’. It is also said that the Throne was made up of Gold, diamonds and various other ornaments.
      <br><br>
      After 12 days of the Coronation ceremony Rajmata Jijabai died on 18th June 1764. The Marathas summoned Bengali Tantrik goswami Nischal Puri, who declared that the original coronation had been held under inauspicious stars, and a second coronation was needed. This second coronation on 24 September 1674 had a dual use, mollifying those who still believed that Shivaji Maharaj was not qualified for the Vedic rites of his first coronation, by performing a less-contestable additional ceremony.<br><br>
      </b></p>
      
    <p><b>
      Campaign to south:
    </b></p>

    <p><b>
      In the mid of 1674, the Marathas undertook an aggressive campaign, raiding Khandesh (October), capturing Bijapuri Ponda (April 1675), Karwar (mid-year), and Kolhapur (July). In November the Maratha navy skirmished with the Siddis of Janjira, but failed to dislodge them. Having recovered from an illness, and taking advantage of a conflict between the Afghans and Bijapur, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj in the guidance of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj raided Athani in April 1676.
       <br><br>
       In the run-up to his expedition Maharaj appealed to a sense of Deccani patriotism, that Southern India was a homeland that should be protected from outsiders. His appeal was somewhat successful, and in 1677 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj visited Hyderabad for a month and entered into a treaty with the Qutubshah of the Golkonda sultanate, agreeing to reject his alliance with Bijapur and jointly oppose the Mughals. In 1677 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj invaded Karnataka with 30,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry, backed by Golkonda artillery and funding. Proceeding south, Shivaji seized the forts of Vellore and Gingee; the latter would later serve as a capital of the Marathas during the reign of his son Rajaram I.
       <br><br>
       Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj intended to reconcile with his half-brother Venkoji (Ekoji I), Shahaji Maharaj’s son by his second wife, Tukabai (née Mohite), who ruled Thanjavur (Tanjore) after Shahaji Maharaj. The initially promising negotiations were unsuccessful, so whilst returning to Raigad Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj defeated his half-brother's army on 26 November 1677 and seized most of his possessions in the Mysore plateau. Venkoji's wife Dipa Bai, whom Shivaji Maharaj deeply respected, took up new negotiations with Maharaj, and also convinced her husband to distance himself from Muslim advisors. 
       <br><br>
       After successfully completing the Campaign to south, after some years In late March 1680, Shivaji Maharaj fell ill with fever and dysentery, and died on 3rd April 1680 on the eve of Hanuman Jayanti.

    <p><b>
      After Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s  death, Maharani Soyarabai made plans with various ministers of the administration to crown her son Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj rather than her stepson Chhatrapati  Sambhaji Maharaj. On 21 April 1680, ten-year-old Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj was installed on the throne. 
    <br><br>
     However Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj acquired control of Raigad and on 16th January 1681 the coronation ceremony of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj took place and was know as the second ruler of the Maratha Swarajya.
      <br><br>
    He was successor of the realm after his father's death, and ruled it for nine years. Chhatrapati Sambhaji maharaj’s  rule was largely shaped by the ongoing wars between the Maratha kingdom and Mughal Empire as well as other neighbouring powers such as the Siddis, Mysore and the Portuguese in Goa. As the Mughals Invaded Deccan which started a 27year war between Marathas and Mughals, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj Protecting Swarajya for almost 9 YEARS from Mughals but in 1689, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was captured near Sangameshwar and then was took as a prisoner where he was brutally tortured and executed by the Mughals.

       After the death of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, Rajaram Maharaj was crowned at Raigad on 12 March 1689. As the Mughals started laying siege to the region around Raigad on 25 March 1689, the widow of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj (Maharani Yesubai) and her minister Ramchandra Pant Amatya sent young Rajaram to the stronghold of Pratapgad through Kavlya ghat. 
      <br><br>
      The Maratha army fought with the Mughals and led the new Maratha king, Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj to escape through Kavlya ghat to the fort of Jinji in present-day state of Tamil Nadu via Pratapgad and Vishalgad forts, Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj reached Keladi (Near present-day Sagar in Karnataka) in disguise and sought refuge from Keladi Chennamma - The brave Kannada queen fought the Mughals and ensured safe passage and escape of Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj to Jinji where he reached after a month and a half on 1 November 1689, Keladi Chennamma fought the guerrilla warfare which frustrated the Mughals and the Mughals proposed peace accord for the first time with an Indian ruler, Keladi Chennamma. Details of this escape are known from the incomplete poetical biography of Rajaram, the Rajaramacharita written by his Rajpurohit, Keshav Pandit, in Sanskrit.

     <p><b>What to see on fort ?</b></p>
    <p><b>
      The Raigad Fort was built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the chief architect/engineer was Hiroji Indulkar. The main palace was constructed using wood, of which only the base pillars remain. The main fort ruins consist of the queen's quarters, six chambers, with each chamber having its own private restroom. In addition, ruins of three watch towers can be seen directly in front of the palace grounds out of which only two remain as the third one was destroyed during a bombardment. The Raigad Fort also has ruins of a market which was accessible to horseback riders. The fort also overlooks an artificial lake known as the Ganga Sagar Lake.<br><br>
      The only main pathway to the fort passes through the "Maha Darwaja" (Huge Door) which was previously closed at sunset. The Maha Darwaja has two huge bastions on both sides of the door which are approximately 65–70 feet in height. The top of the fort is 600 ft above this door.<br><br>
      The King's Darbar, inside the Raigad Fort has a replica of the original throne that faces the main doorway called the Nagarkhana Darwaja. This enclosure had been acoustically designed to aid hearing from the doorway to the throne. A secondary entrance, called the Mena Darwaja, was supposedly the private entrance for the royal ladies of the fort that lead to the queen's quarters. The convoy of the king and the king himself used the Palkhi Darwaja. To the right of Palkhi Darwaja, is a row of three dark and deep chambers. Historians believe that these were the granaries for the fort.<br><br>
      From the fort, one can view the execution point called Takmak Tok, a cliff from which sentenced prisoners were thrown to their death. This area has been fenced off.<br><br>
      The statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is erected in front of the ruins of the main market avenue that leads to the Jagdishwar Mandir and his own Samadhi and that of his loyal dog named Waghya. The Samadhi of Jijabai, Chatrapati Shivaji's mother, can be seen at base village of Pachad.<br><br>
      Additional famous attractions of the fort include the Khubladha Buruj, Nane Darwaja and the Hatti Talav (Elephant Lake).<br><br>
    </b></p>
    <p><b>Hirakani Buruj:</b></p>
    <p><b>The fort has a famous wall called "Hirakani Buruj" (Hirakani Bastion) constructed over a huge steep cliff. The legend goes "that a woman by the name of Hirakani from a nearby village had come to sell milk to the people living at the fort. She happened to be inside the fort when the gates got closed and locked at sunset. Hearing the cries of her infant son back at the village echo after nightfall, the anxious mother couldn't wait till dawn and courageously climbed down the steep cliff in pitch darkness all for the love of her little one. She later repeated this extraordinary feat in front of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and was bravely rewarded for it." In appreciation of her courage and bravery, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj built the Hirakani Bastion over this cliff.</b></p>

      Mahad Ganpati Temple or Varad Vinayak, also spelt as Varadavinayaka, is one of the Ashtavinayak temples of the Hindu deity Ganesha. It is located in Mahad village situated in Khalapur taluka near Karjat and Khopoli of Raigad District, Maharastra, India.

      The Varad Vinayak Mahad Ganpati Temple is the Seventh Ganesha temple to be visited during the Ashtavinayak Darshan tour. The idol at the Varad Vinayak Mahad Ganpati Temple is Swyambhu and the temple is actually recognised as a Math.
      
      The temple is very simply designed with a tiled roof, a dome 25 feet high with golden pinnacle and a golden summit (Kalas) which has a carving of a cobra (also a deity revered by Hindus). The Temple is 8 feet long & 8 feet broad.

    <p><b>
      Lingana is a massive pinnacle on the mainline of the Sahyadris between Raigad and Torna. It is in the Mahad Taluka of Raigad district. It is 35 km away from Mahad town. It takes its name from its shape which is like a linga. It is 2969 feet high with an ascent of four miles, the first half is easy to climb while the second is difficult. Its rock cut steps have been destroyed and the fort is almost completely inaccessible. The top of the fortified rock is 2500 feet square. No fortifications or buildings remain but there are traces of a grain store and some cisterns. Lingana fort was built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in 1648 to secure central Konkan against the Sidis. Under the Marathas, Lingana was used as a penal settlement. The prisoners were confined to rock dungeons with one dungeon holding 50 prisoners. Lingana was captured by a Colonel Prother in 1818.
